    <h1>My name is Natalie — welcome to my hobbies</h1>

    <!-- Description of my hobbies -->
    <p>
        one of my hobby is to be a public speaker. I love, I have a podcast, I like talking in front of a camera and also in front of people or of like big events. 
        Talking mainly about my knowledge, things, experiences that I have had. And yeah, so my hobby and I love doing it, like with fashion and dressing well.

        So if you wanna go to shopping and you don't know what to wear, just contact me. I think like, if you are a man, the best way to attract a woman is the way to dress. 
        And a lot of people that I know in here don't dress well. If you want any fashion advice, I will be more than willing to give you. 
        
        <!-- Another line break -->
        <br/> 
        
        And about speaking in public, of course, another hobby I have and I'm really good at. So just calculate the fare. 
        If you're willing to just schedule a call with me, I will be more than happy to help you in these two areas if it's something that you need to improve on.
